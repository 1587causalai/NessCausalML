Econometrics and other social sciences have long been studying which variables predict a smaller or larger than average treatment effect, which in statistical terms is also known as Moderation.

In this blog post, I will always assume that the data is from a randomised experiment, such that the assumptions to identify treatment effects are valid without further complications.

    "Yoshua Bengio, one of the world’s most highly recognized AI experts, explained in a recent Wired interview: “It’s a big thing to integrate [causality] into AI. Current approaches to machine learning assume that the trained AI system will be applied on the same kind of data as the training data. In real life it is often not the case.” \n",

    "全球知名度最高的AI专家之一Yoshua Bengio在《连线》杂志最近的一次采访中解释说：“将因果关系整合到AI中是一件大事。当前的机器学习方法假设受过训练的AI系统将与训练数据应用于相同类型的数据。在现实生活中，情况往往并非如此。”最近的图灵奖获得者Yann LeCun在推特上持相同观点：“许多ML / DL（深度学习）人员知道因果推理是提高泛化的重要方法。”\n",
    "\n",
    "因果推理和机器学习可以解决当今机器学习面临的最大问题之一-许多现实世界的数据生成的方式与我们用来训练AI模型的数据的方式不同。这意味着机器学习模型通常不足以处理输入数据类型的变化，而且不能总是一概而论。相比之下，因果推理通过考虑在缺乏信息时可能发生的情况来明确克服了这个问题。最终，这意味着我们可以利用因果推理使ML模型更健壮和更通用。"

    "- 机器学习与因果推理：机器学习与因果推理之间存在丰富的相互作用。机器学习不仅为传统的因果推断技术提供了扩展方法，以利用当今的大规模，高维数据集进行关键的政策评估和质量决策，而且搜索算法等计算方法对于创建AutoCausal至关重要-一个自动化的数据科学家，可以集成领域知识，验证因果假设并按AutoML调整超参数。同时，因果推理方法和见解与鲁棒性，可概括性，偏见和可解释性等核心机器学习挑战直接相关。此外，对因果关系的理解被广泛认为是当前AI方法的关键缺陷，并且是构建更多类似人的机器智能的必要先驱。\n",
